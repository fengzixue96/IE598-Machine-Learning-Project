MLF_GP2_EconCycle contains 223 monthly observations of the US Treasury bond yield curve, the commercial paper yield curve and the USPHCI Economic Activity Index.  
In 1993 Friedman and Kuttner published a paper entitled "Why does the Paper-Bill spread predict real economic activity?"  
They found evidence that the spread on commercial paper, a short term form of corporate borrowing, 
and the US Treasury bill widens before recessions and contracts after and could be a useful predictor of real economic activity.  
We will not rigorously replicate this study, but instead use it as the basis for a regression exercise in machine learning.  
(Although this is a time series dataset, we will not be using it as such. 
You should discard the Date column and treat each row as an independent observation.  
You should also standardize all your data, otherwise your model will overfit to the level, since USHPCI is rising throughout this period.)

This is real world data that has been modifed for this exercise.
