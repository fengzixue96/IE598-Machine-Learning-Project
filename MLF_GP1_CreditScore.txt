MLF_GP1_CreditScore contains 1700 observations of 26 financial and accounting metrics changes for a set of firms in several different industries.

The Class label is the Moody's credit rating assigned to the firm in the following quarter.  
Certain ratings are considered "Investment Grade" (=1), 
other ratings are not (=0) and consequently may not be held in certain institutional portfolios (pension plans, etc.)  
This is real world data that has been modified for this exercise - it has been normalized, but does still contain some extreme outliers.
